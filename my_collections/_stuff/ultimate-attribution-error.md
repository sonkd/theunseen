Like fundamental attribution error but applied to groups. When out-groups behave poorly, or in-groups behave well, we attribute it to their intrinsic characteristics. And when out-groups behave well or our in-group behaves poorly, we do the opposite and attribute those behaviors to circumstances and chance.
