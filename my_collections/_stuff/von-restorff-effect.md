Hedwig Von Restorff put a name to the phenomenon of how, in a list of things that have something in common, if one of them does not have that thing in common will be more likely to be noticed. For example, in this list: desk, “chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser, stool, couch” you are likely to notice and remember the chipmunk more than the others. Also known as the isolation effect.
