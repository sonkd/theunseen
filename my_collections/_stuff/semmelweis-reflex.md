An extreme case of ostrich effect that describes our tendency to flat out reject new evidence simply because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms. Example: when it was first discovered that fatality rates dropped dramatically when doctors started washing their hands, this was rejected because doctors refused to believe that germs could be transmitted by hands.
