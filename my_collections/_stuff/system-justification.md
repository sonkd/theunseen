We desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about ourselveas (ego-justification) and the groups we belong to (group-justification), but also want to hold positive attitudes about the overarching social structure these groups are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification). In other words, if a system is broken in some way, we assume it's broken for a good reason.
