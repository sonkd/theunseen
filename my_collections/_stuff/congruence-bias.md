Similar to confirmation bias, but specific to the world of interpreting new information, and testing hypotheses. Say that you’ve got some numbers (2, 4, 6) and are asked to guess the rule between them. You may assume the rule is a “plus 2” rule, and, given the chance to test your rule, test numbers like (3, 5, 7) and (1, 3, 5), which also result in a positive test. Your congruence bias leads you to have high confidence in your rule’s truth, and it generally doesn’t occur to you to ask if (1, 2, 3) or (4, 8, 9) are also true, to test whether or not the rule is something more general than “plus 2”, and instead something more general like “numbers go up”.
