We have some ability to control what our brain is paying attention to, or watching for. However, it can only handle a couple tasks at a time, and becomes blind to other things that would otherwise grab our attention. A good example of this is that video that asks us to count how many times the players in white pass a basketball between each other, and we completely miss a gorilla walking through the group.
