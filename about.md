Plato believed that what we perceive through our senses is just a shadow of true reality. In his famous *Allegory of the Cave*<sup id="plato-says">[[1]](#ref-1)</sup>, he argued that we live in a world of illusions, and only through reason can we access the "Forms"â€”eternal truths that lie beyond what we see. Similarly, in Buddhism, the "Three Wise Monkeys"<sup id="3-monkeys">[[2]](#ref-2)</sup> teach mindfulness and ethical conduct, encouraging us to be mindful instead of what we see ðŸ™ˆ , hear ðŸ™‰, and say ðŸ™Š.

Like a prism, this site refracts the ordinary into a spectrum of availability stuff, revealing what has been hidden in plain sight. We see the invisible stuff through the prism of science to understand how our brain works and makes decisions; we'll focus on psychology, cognitive load theory<sup id="cognitive-load">[[3]](#ref-2)</sup>, our faith, the social impact on us, and so on.

##### Flames ðŸ”¥
This site aims to share [stuff]({{site.baseurl}}/category/) as flames, a metaphor for sharing knowledge that can ignite new perspectives and understanding. We try to present theoretical, abstract, and complex content simply and concisely that is easy to understand and absorb in the hope that it can challenge and change your beliefs and perceptions.
